Paul Bollington - Head of EResearch Monash
  - Project Sponsor
  - Keep Happy

Monash Biomedical Engineering and Medical Imaging
- ALL IMAGING
- ANIMALS/PEOPLE

NeuroScience 

Gary Egan - Professor formerly from Monash. More Medical - scientist
       - David Barnfetter - more technical - reports to Gary Egan

DARIS - working with NEil. 
Porting DARIS to Monash
- Data Access Portal to neuroimaging images
- Extend to track information on experimental process - somehow?
	- Condition - not tracking everyone

Neurology/Imaging - RADIOLOGY

Extending DARIS in multiple directions

Monash Caulfield - Image processing - Scripts for Computer Vision (Kepler)
  - Requires a cluster to process
  - Mildly involved

nnf

Workflows - Processing of imaging
Method - everything done in an experiment before an image is done (APPROACH)

XNAT

A tool which enables researchers to create new kinds of methods
 - A method development language ~ XML
 - + GUI with MediaFlux GWC to fit into DARIS portal


David Barnes/Gare Egan = Vague in a good way :: results driven

Neil Tilly (Parkville based) - DARS driven

Digital Asset Management system - distributed


JAVA driven development


Mediaflux is backend - is it ORM ..... XML database accessed by Java classes
DAta Access layer - 

MVC concept with layered data and model.....

NIGTK = NeuroImaging Toolkit

DICOM protocol
DARS is the Portal
Mediaflux is the framework
GWT is the interface
JAVA is the basic language
NeuroImaging files as Binary Blobs following protocol DICOM....

Jason Laurie is arcitecta (A good programmer) 

HOW to change a workflow mid-process

Method =~ clinical protocol
Workflow is anterior to method...

Unique id across any mediaflux server. uid (like an exact post-code)

Mediaflux commandline tutorial - of itself translates commands back and forth....can talk to stored procedures

Wilson - built DARIS and supports

sbennett

Mediaflux Desktop - web look into MediaFlux

Kepler workflows






MBI - Monash Biomedical Engineering


Agenda for WILSON 2pm (developer for DARIS for Melbourne)- 

1. Questions about framework
2. GWT integration
3. Functional Requirements - STRICT
4. ~~ MediaFlux interaction with DARIS
5. Need to speak with Neil
6. What to salvage 
7. As quick as posisble for phase 1
8. More Creative in  Phase 2..
9. Are we just filling a gap?
10. Changes to the DATA layer
11. Formal Definition of a Method - constraint based
12. Rich Interace Architecture

The Long tail vs the fourth Paradigm
\


MOST IMPORTANT

1. Agree to modelling languages for
- Data structures
- Object Models
- Software Components

Stakeholders
Users and user Types
Use Cases
Domains/Subdomains
Organisations


Function Points

 -  GWT/JQuery set of widgets to string together methods 
 -  Method Types
 - Synchronicity
 - Conditionals
 - service request

 - Method Search


MediaFlux Services – stored procedures – connecting  to DARIS

Put mouth to sleep/ wake mouse up. 
Workflow…
Method is a series of steps.  High-level. Method Builder supports computational steps.
IP Boundaries and linkage grants with plugin capability 
-	Plugin – generic
-	Computational steps as plugin.
-	Audit Trail – no longer necessary
-	Workflow => Method…Metadata
-	Sequence graph for steps
-	Does XMethod have synchronicity
o	Multiple xmethods on 1 
-	Rules behind method exstensibility
-	GUI – has rules enshrined in methods
-	How to model rules? Predicates as rules (z) 
-	Method is global – could be consumed by any project
-	Can rules apply between subject and method
-	Categorize methods 
-	Adding keywords 
-	Open source methods
-	No permission to say which projects use a specific method
-	Federated methods
-	Policy in federation 
-	Federation on 2 serves with CSIRO/Monash
-	Distributed queries across federations – handles cycles
-	Sharing methods - when? GUID
-	Creates a group of Doctypes -  DocType Builder
-	SubjectCreator can only use registered methods (Not required)
-	Ownership of membership
-	Extension outside project
-	Method Creation/Method Search/ Management
-	Replace XMethod if needed….
-	Exception Handling – step is done or not done
-	Quality control of data – capabilities More likely on the data…
-	StateChart/Graph as model of steps in a model
-	GWT Client library for MediaFLux
-	DARIS services can be called by GWT Client	

CREATE/REVISE/Sanitized REMOVE/
Service Oriented Architecture – for Model
View = GWT
DataMode = MFServer
SingleController = DARIS

-	Add Method
-	Links to what? 
-	Ajax request 
-	GWT renders everything
-	Every request is ajax
-	Java Applet for File Upload
-	JVM 
-	JDK 6.0 – cannot call
-	Gwt
-	Pure java on top of 
-	Extend a model – enhance a plugin service or a new plugin service
-	MediaFlux GWT 
-	Own functions to communicate with media flux server
-	Browser Compatibility – 
-	JQuery – have to write functions to connect to media server
-	Library will convert response to xml
-	GWT as compiler of java to java script.
-	HARD-CODE link to new functions.
-	Stand-alone web application or a component of DARIS
-	Single web application – integrate as module inside application
o	Implement DARIS classes
-	Convention of being told what-to-do.
-	DocType builder in desktop….
o	A set of steps + docTypes….
DOCTYPES – xml form like XSL schema
Namespaces for XML structure
Schema is a unique combination of yaml/xsl
